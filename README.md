## Translations
This mod is available into *english* and *german*. <br> <br>
Because of that some of the german translations are a little wierd, I changed them manually.
<br>
Well, I don't know why, but names don't get translated... <br> I hope I find a way to fix that soon. Until that, I focus on making new content.
